Entity:
    - Strength, Maturity, MaxChilds, Lifetime, Current Lifetime, ColonyID values:
        - Health, Strength, Maturity, MaxChilds and Lifetime defined by parent (Or by default values if it's the initial cell)
        - For any step, cells move randomly and Current Lifetime value increases by 1
            - If Current_Lifetime >= Lifetime then cell dies
            - If Current_Lifetime >= Maturity then cells reproduces:
                - For every child:
                    - Mutation probability of 10% based of Parent Values.
            - Only for test reasons: If two cells of the same colony collides, one of them dies.

    - If entity encounter with other entity of different colony.
        - Starts combat (Cell with highest Strength will win)
